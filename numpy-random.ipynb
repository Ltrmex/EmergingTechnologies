    "    NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a\n",
    "    multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of\n",
    "    routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O,\n",
    "    discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Numpy Random package can be categorised into:\n",
    "- __Simple random data__, which includes functions for everyday use, such as __*rand(d0, d1, â€¦, dn)*__ to generate random values in a given shape.\n",
    "- __Permutations__, which includes function such as __*shuffle(x)*__ to modify a sequence in-place by shuffling its contents.\n",
    "- __Distributions__, which are realated to different probability distributions, example of a function would be __*exponential([scale, size])*__ which would draw samples from an exponential distribution.\n",
    "- __Random generator__ which includes function such as __*seed([seed])*__ to seed the generator."
