# EmergingTechnologies
Main assignment project for Emerging technologies which required to investigate package, two datasets, writing digit recognition program, and explaining written code.


## Files: 
- **numpy-random.ipynb**
  - A jupyter notebook explaining the concepts behind and the use of the numpy package, including plots of the various distributions.

- **iris-dataset.ipynb**
  - A jupyter notebook explaining the famous iris dataset including the difficulty in writing an algorithm to separate the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset.
  
- **mnist-dataset.ipynb**
  - A jupyter notebook explaining how to read the MNIST dataset effciently into memory in Python.

- **digitrec.py**
  - A python script that takes an image file containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a supervised learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset.

- **digit-recognition.ipynb**
  - A jupyter notebook explaining how the above Python script works and discussing its performance.


## How to run
### Requirements
  - Github
  - Jupyter Notebook + python
  - TensorFlow
  - Might require additional libraries that have not been mentioned here
  
### Clone the repositiory
  - First open command prompt by typing "cmd" in search box on windows
  - In command prompt navigate to place where you would like to store cloned repository
    - Example: type $ cd Desktop/NewRepo
  - Type the following command: $ git clone https://github.com/Ltrmex/EmergingTechnologies

### Running the program
  - First navigate to repository location, for example: $ cd Desktop/NewRepo/EmergingTechnologies
  - To run any of the notebook just type $ jupyter notebook in the given repository 
  - To run the code type $ python digitrec.py , wait a moment and follow onscreen instructions
