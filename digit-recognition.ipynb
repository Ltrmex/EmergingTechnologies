One of these values is set to 1, to represent the digit at that index of the vector, and the rest are set to 0. For example, the digit 3 is represented using the vector [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. As the value at index 3 is stored as 1, the vector therefore represents the digit 3.\n",

    "- The architecture of the neural network refers to elements such as the number of layers in the network, the number of units in each layer, and how the units are connected between layers. As neural networks are loosely inspired by the workings of the human brain, here the term unit is used to represent what we would biologically think of as a neuron. Like neurons passing signals around the brain, units take some values from previous units as input, perform a computation, and then pass on the new value as output to other units. These units are layered to form the network, starting at a minimum with one layer for inputting values, and one layer to output values. The term hidden layer is used for all of the layers in between the input and output layers, i.e. those \"hidden\" from the real world.\n",

Given enough training data, a shallow neural network with a sufficient number of units should theoretically be able to represent any function that a deep neural network can. But it is often more computationally efficient to use a smaller deep neural network to achieve the same task that would require a shallow network with exponentially more hidden units. Shallow neural networks also often encounter overfitting, where the network essentially memorizes the training data that it has seen, and is not able to generalize the knowledge to new data. This is why deep neural networks are more commonly used: the multiple layers between the raw input data and the output label allow the network to learn features at various levels of abstraction, making the network itself better able to generalize."

The number of iterations refers to how many times we go through the training step, and the batch size refers to how many training examples we are using at each step. The dropout variable represents a threshold at which we elimanate some units at random. We will be using dropout in our final hidden layer to give each unit a 50% chance of being eliminated at every training step. This helps prevent overfitting."
